# Machine Learning SS 2022 Team Project
<br>
In this project, we make use of the binary classifier we trained on the transactions dataset to detect fraudulent transactions.<br>
In the leader_board_predict_fn function contains the code that loads our model parameters and returns the likelyhood of fraud for each transaction (i.e. row) in the values dataframe.<br> The higher the decision function value, the more likely that the transaction is fraud. <br>
We used three different machine learning models and trained them with the given transactions data, and yielded the score,<br>
to find the model that showed best performance.
