# Machine Learning SS 2022 Team Project
<br>
In this project, we make use of the binary classifier we trained on the transcations dataset to detect fraudulent transactions.
In the leader_board_predict_fn function contains the code that loads our model parameters and returns the likelyhood of fraud for each transaction (i.e. row) in the values dataframe. The higher the decision function value, the more likely that the transaction is fraud.
